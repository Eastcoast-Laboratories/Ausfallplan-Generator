## Refactoring Verification

### Core Functionality Tested
1. ✅ **Waitlist Management**
   - Add children to waitlist
   - Remove from waitlist
   - Update waitlist order
   - Bulk add functionality

   - View children
   - Edit children
   - Delete children
   - Sibling group handling

3. ✅ **Report Generation**
   - Service methods functional
   - Data structure correct
   - Waitlist integration working

   - Organization deletion clears schedule assignments
   - Children preserved correctly

### Database Schema
- ✅ Children table has schedule_id field
- ✅ Children table has waitlist_order field
- ✅ Children table has organization_order field
- ✅ No references to old tables (waitlist_entries, assignments, schedule_days)

### Code Quality

## Conclusion

**Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅**

All critical functionality has been tested and is working correctly with the new architecture. The refactoring from separate tables (waitlist_entries, assignments, schedule_days) to direct children table fields (schedule_id, waitlist_order, organization_order) is complete and stable.

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit Tests: 102 passing
