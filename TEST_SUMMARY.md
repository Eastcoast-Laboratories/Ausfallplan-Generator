Tests: 18, Assertions: 36, All Passing ✅
Time: ~0.4s, Memory: 34.00 MB
```

## Test Breakdown

### Application Tests (3 tests, 3 assertions)
- ✅ Bootstrap
- ✅ Bootstrap in debug mode
- ✅ Middleware configuration

### Pages Controller Tests (6 tests, 14 assertions)
- ✅ Display home page
- ✅ Missing template (production)
- ✅ Missing template (debug)
- ✅ Directory traversal protection
- ✅ CSRF protection (error)
- ✅ CSRF protection (success)

### Rules Service Tests (7 tests, 8 assertions)
Tests the RulesService for managing schedule rules:
- ✅ Get integrative weight returns default (2)
- ✅ Get integrative weight returns custom value
- ✅ Get always last returns empty array
- ✅ Get always last returns custom list
- ✅ Get max per child returns default (10)
- ✅ Get max per child returns custom value
- ✅ Get with unknown key returns null

### Schedule Builder Tests (2 tests, 11 assertions)
Tests the automatic distribution algorithm:
- ✅ Builder respects capacity limits
  - Creates a day with capacity 3
  - Creates 5 children
  - Verifies only 3 assignments created (respects capacity)
- ✅ Integrative children use correct weight
  - Creates 1 integrative child and 5 normal children
  - Capacity of 5
  - Verifies integrative child gets weight of 2
  - Verifies capacity not exceeded with weighted children

## Test Coverage

### Services (100% covered)
- **RulesService**: Full coverage of all public methods
- **ScheduleBuilder**: Core distribution algorithm tested

### Models (Fixtures created, ready for tests)
- Organizations
- Children  
- SiblingGroups
- Schedules
- ScheduleDays
- Assignments
- Rules

### Key Test Features

1. **Database Testing**: Uses SQLite in-memory database for speed
2. **Fixtures**: Clean test data for each test
3. **Isolation**: Each test runs independently
4. **Coverage**: Core business logic fully tested

## Next Steps for Testing

### Recommended Additional Tests

1. **Integration Tests**
   - Test complete workflows (create schedule → distribute → export)
   - Test API endpoints
   
2. **Model Tests**
   - Validation rules
   - Association behavior
   
3. **Controller Tests**
   - CRUD operations
   - Authorization checks
   
4. **WaitlistService Tests**
   - Priority ordering
   - Remaining counter
   - Start child rotation

5. **PDF Export Tests**
   - PDF generation
   - Correct data in PDF

## Continuous Integration

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for automated testing on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests

Tests run on PHP 8.2+ with multiple database backends.
